## Changelog (Part 1 -> Part 2 -> Part 3)
- **Part 1**: Initial static HTML pages created with semantic structure and content.
- **Part 2**: Externalized CSS (`style.css`), added responsive grid, typography, and breakpoints. Implemented consistent navbar and card styling. Added alt text for images and image placeholders in `images/`.
- **Part 3**: Implemented JS interactivity (`script.js`) — client-side validation, lightbox for stories, smooth anchor scrolling, demo donation flow, and Leaflet map. Added `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` for SEO. Improved meta descriptions and headings for on-page SEO.

## Screenshots
- Take screenshots of Desktop (>=1200px), Tablet (768–991px) and Mobile (<=576px) views using DevTools and add to `screenshots/` before submission.

## Submission
- Push the folder to a private GitHub repository.
- Update README with commit history and the changelog entries above.
- Submit the GitHub repo link to LMS along with the Word/PDF Project Proposal as required.

## Notes for markers
- Forms use client-side validation and demo flows (no backend). Mailto is used for contact form and donation uses alert demo. Replace with server-side handling or payment gateway integration for production.
